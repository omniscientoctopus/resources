# Textbooks

- The standard (and arguably the best) textbook on reinforcement learning: 
    
    [Reinforcement Learning: An Introduction](http://incompleteideas.net/book/RLbook2020.pdf) by Richard S. Sutton and Andrew G. Barto.

- [Algorithms for decision making](https://algorithmsbook.com)

- [REINFORCEMENT LEARNING AND OPTIMAL CONTROL](http://www.mit.edu/~dimitrib/RLbook.html)

# Online Lectures
[Introduction to AI](https://people.eecs.berkeley.edu/~russell/classes/cs188/f14/lecture_videos.html). I found the videos on Markov Decision Processes, and Reinforcement Learning quite useful.

[Introduction to Reinforcement Learning with David Silver (UCL)](https://www.deepmind.com/learning-resources/introduction-to-reinforcement-learning-with-david-silver "https://www.deepmind.com/learning-resources/introduction-to-reinforcement-learning-with-david-silver")

**Deep Reinforcement Learning Lectures**

High level overview

# Talks

[Multi-Agent Learning Seminar](https://www.youtube.com/@multi-agentlearningseminar5144)


# Demos

[Demos for basic algorithms](https://cs.stanford.edu/people/karpathy/reinforcejs/index.html) by Andrej Karpathy. They are great for building intuition without having to write any code.

# Programming 

I recommend using Python for reinforcement learning. The following are some useful libraries for (deep) reinforcement learning in Python.

I would recommend starting here:
- [spinningup](https://spinningup.openai.com/en/latest/spinningup/spinningup.html). Deep reinforcement learning can be a bit difficult to get working at first, but spinningup is nice guide to avoid common pitfalls.

Before you start writing your own algorithms, you should be familiar with the existing libraries. The following are some of the most popular libraries for reinforcement learning in Python.
- [cleanrl](https://docs.cleanrl.dev) (Beginner friendly with good documentation)

- [stable-baselines](https://stable-baselines.readthedocs.io)

After you have made your way into the world of deep reinforcement learning, and have seen the struggles of training agents, you will appreciate John Schulman's advice [Deep RL Bootcamp Lecture 6: Nuts and Bolts of Deep RL Experimentation](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ggqnxyjaKe4).
